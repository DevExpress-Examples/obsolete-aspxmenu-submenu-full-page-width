⛔ DEPRECATED. This example illustrated how to implement a submenu with a full page width. Starting with version 14.2, <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxMenutopic">ASPxMenu</a> provides the built-in capability to display a submenu with the full page width. To activate this feature, set the <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxMenu.EnableSubMenuFullWidth">EnableSubMenuFullWidth</a> property to `true`.


You can try this functionality in the following online demo:
